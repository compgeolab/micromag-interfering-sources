Magnetic microscopy mapping for paleomagnetic studies has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its high accuracy and robustness. However, due to the nature of the magnetic field, it is difficult to accurately estimate the magnetic source's position and dipole moment. This study proposes a new methodology to mitigate the magnetic sources' interference and enhance the precision of the inversion analyses proposed. The proposed methodology is based on refining the isolation of the primary signal and integrating the "interfering sources" algorithm, which addresses one of the previous code's limitations. Moreover, the proposed methodology was applied to synthetic data to assess the algorithm's reliability and precision, reinforcing the advancement of paleomatrix data analysis and setting a definitive path for future enhancements.
