@article{Nagy2017,
abstract = {When magnetic crystals form in rocks and meteorites, they can record the ancient magnetic field and retain this information over geological timescales. Scientists use these magnetic recordings to study the evolution of the Earth and the Solar System. Previous theories for the recording mechanisms of the magnetic crystals in rocks and meteorites are based on the idea that the magnetic structures within crystals are near uniform. However, from numerous studies we know this not to be true. The crystals are too large in size and display complex nonuniform ‚Äúvortex‚Äù structures. In this study we have shown that vortex structures are capable of recording and retaining magnetic signals over billions of years.},

Scientists use these magnetic recordings to study the evolution of the Earth and the Solar System. Previous theories for the recording mechanisms of the magnetic crystals in rocks and meteorites are based on the idea that the magnetic structures within crystals are near uniform. However, from numerous studies we know this not to be true. The crystals are too large in size and display complex nonuniform ‚Äúvortex‚Äù structures. In this study we have shown that vortex structures are capable of recording and retaining magnetic signals over billions of years.},

abstract = {Most rock magnetometers measure the bulk remanent magnetization of 1-inch cylindrical samples (centimeter scale) or even larger volumes of drill cores. High-Tc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers are able to measure magnetic fields on rock surfaces at higher resolution on a millimeter scale: the fields of discrete rock-forming magnetic mineral grains or fine magnetic rock textures and structures can be observed when scanning across selected surface areas. The stability problems of a commercially available high-Tc SQUID magnetometer have largely been solved by improving the magnetic shielding and reducing the noise due to turbulent boiling of liquid nitrogen. Magnetizations as weak as 5√ó10-4 A/m can now be discriminated with a resolution of 1 mm. A software package has been developed to eliminate measurement errors arising from instrumental drift. The program also calculates the downwards continuation of the field data and offers full inversion for the vertical magnetization component. A synthetic sample demonstrates the performance of the SQUID sensor and the inversion software. The potential of high-resolution magnetic imaging is shown by measuring three rock samples with very different magnetic properties. Copyright 2000 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Souza-Junior2023b,
abstract = {Paleomagnetic data is collected from bulk samples, containing a mixture of stable and unstable magnetic particles. Recently, magnetic microscopy techniques have allowed the examination of individual magnetic grains. However, accurately determining the magnetic moments of these grains is difficult and time-consuming due to the inherent ambiguity of potential field data and the large number of grains in each image. Here we introduce a fast and semi-automated algorithm that estimates the position and magnetization of each magnetic source solely based on magnetic microscopy data, without requiring any additional information. The algorithm follows a three-step process. Firstly, it employs image processing techniques to identify and isolate data window boundaries for each magnetic source. Secondly, the algorithm uses Euler deconvolution to estimate their positioning. Lastly, the algorithm solves an overdetermined linear inverse problem, using a dipolar approximation, to determine the direction and intensity of the magnetic dipole moment for each source. To validate the algorithm, we conducted tests analyzing particle depth, intensity, and non-dipolarity. Additionally, synthetic data experiments were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in recovering the position and magnetic information of both dipolar and non-dipolar sources. These experiments included complex samples designed to simulate real rock data. Then, we applied it to real data, where it accurately retrieved the expected directions induced in the sample. The semi-automated nature of our algorithm, combined with its low processing cost and ability to simultaneously analyze the magnetic moments of numerous particles, represents a significant advancement in facilitating paleomagnetic applications of magnetic microscopy..},

abstract = {Complex magnetic domain structures and the energy barriers between them are responsible for pseudo-single-domain phenomena in rock magnetism and contribute significantly to the magnetic remanence of paleomagnetic samples. This article introduces MERRILL, an open source software package for three-dimensional micromagnetics optimized and designed for the calculation of such complex structures. MERRILL has a simple scripting user interface that requires little computational knowledge to use but provides research strength algorithms to model complex, inhomogeneous domain structures in magnetic materials. It uses a finite element/boundary element numerical method, optimally suited for calculating magnetization structures of local energy minima (LEM) in irregular grain geometries that are of interest to the rock and paleomagnetic community. MERRILL is able to simulate the magnetic characteristics of LEM states in both single grains, and small assemblies of interacting grains, including saddle-point paths between nearby LEMs. Here the numerical model is briefly described, and an overview of the scripting language and available commands is provided. The open source nature of the code encourages future development of the model by the scientific community.},

({\S}{\S} 40, 41, 57), the ratio Qk of T.R.M. acquired in a given field to the induced magnetization in the same field ({\S} 42), the additivity of partial T.R.M.'s in the case both of small grains ({\S} 28) and large grains ({\S} 57).Considerable space is devoted to the magnetic ‚Äòviscosity' due to thermal agitation in small grains ({\S}{\S} 24‚Äì27) and in larger ones ({\S}{\S} 49‚Äì56). Expressions are given for magnetic ‚Äòviscosity' in the range of Rayleigh's relations ({\S} 51) particularly with a demagnetizing field present ({\S} 54). The theoretical and experimental results on the irreversible decrease in isothermal remanent magnetization are briefly quoted both for small ({\S} 30) and large ({\S} 55) grains. Different reversing mechanisms are reviewed which could cause a negative T.R.M., that is one directed in the opposite sense to the field applied during cooling. Some are related to negative Weiss-Heisenberg exchange forces: reversal by diffusion involving ionic exchange between the two sub-lattices in a ferrimagnetic ({\S} 7), reversal by anomalous thermal variation is spontaneous magnetization ({\S}{\S} 11, 12), reversal by diffusion with complete change of composition ({\S} 16). The others are effects of the demagnetizing field: reversal in mixtures of two constituents with different Curie Points ({\S}{\S} 31‚Äì34), reversal by segregation, allotropy and chemical alteration ({\S} 35).

@incollection{OReilly1984,
abstract = {The constitution of rock and mineral magnetism and its 'applications' or 'connections' are discussed in section 1.3. Some applications depend on the physical models of rock and mineral magnetism, and the extent to which rock and mineral magnetism research has provided experimental support for the models. The models essentially concern the acquisition and rem oval of weak field remanences, and form the physical basis for determinations of the direction and intensity ofthe ancient geomagnetic field, and the inferences which can be made from such adetermination. The models also suggest methods by which the palaeomagnetic signal may be distinguished from 'noise'. The models are applied in geological problems, such as the determination of emplacement temperatures, or in 'magnetic granulometry' with many areas of interest from technology to cosmology. A second species of application is found in the methods and techniques of rock and mineral magnetism, largely the determination of the composition, concentration and microstructure of the magnetic fraction of a rock or artefact. This provides the chemical basis of palaeomagnetism and palaeo-intensity studies, and can be used to monitor changes induced in a rock or artefact during laboratory heating. It also finds application as a tool in petrology, in environmental studies, and in the biologicaljmedical area. The knowledge and experience of rock and mineral magnetism also finds application in a number of other areas which might be grouped together under the heading of 'planetary physics'. They often involve large-scale phenomena, in some cases at remote distances, or the properties of inaccessible materials. Several questions-the properties of the source material contributing to the magnetic field measured at the surface of the Earth or other Earth-type planet, the depth of the Curie point isotherm, the origin of the seismomagnetic and volcanomagnetic effects, the magnetic and magneto-mineralogical effects of meteoritic impact, and the mechanism of magnetiza-tion of the crusts of Earth-type bodies in the solar system-may find some answer in the body of rock and mineral magnetism knowledge.},

abstract = {The thermomagnetic behavior of remanence-induced magnetite (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) particles in the pseudo-single-domain (PSD) size range (‚àº0.1-10-$\mu$m), which dominate the magnetic signature of many rock lithologies, is investigated using off-axis electron holography. Construction of magnetic induction maps allowed for the visualization of the vortex domain state in an individual Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> grain (‚àº200-nm in diameter) as a function of temperature. Acquisition of a series of electron holograms at 100¬∞C intervals during in situ heating up to 700¬∞C demonstrates the vortex state of the Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> grain, in this instance, remains thermally stable close to its unblocking temperature and exhibits a similar in-plane remanent state upon cooling; i.e., the particle is effectively behaving like a uniaxial single-domain particle to temperatures near T<inf>C</inf>. Such particles are thought to be robust magnetic recorders. It is suggested that evidence for PSD behavior should therefore not preclude paleomagnetic investigation.

@article{Farchi2017,
abstract = {Magnetization in rock samples is crucial for paleomagnetometry research, as it harbors valuable geological information on long term processes, such as tectonic movements and the formation of oceans and continents. Nevertheless, current techniques are limited in their ability to measure high spatial resolution and high-sensitivity quantitative vectorial magnetic signatures from individual minerals and micrometer scale samples. As a result, our understanding of bulk rock magnetization is limited, specifically for the case of multi-domain minerals. In this work, we use a newly developed nitrogen-vacancy magnetic microscope, capable of quantitative vectorial magnetic imaging with optical resolution. We demonstrate direct imaging of the vectorial magnetic field of a single, multi-domain dendritic magnetite, as well as the measurement and calculation of the weak magnetic moments of an individual grain on the micron scale. These results pave the way for future applications in paleomagnetometry and for the fundamental understanding of magnetization in multi-domain samples.},

@article{Nichols2016,
abstract = {Recent paleomagnetic studies of two Main Group pallasites, the Imilac and Esquel, have found evidence for a strong, late-stage magnetic field on the parent body. It has been hypothesized that this magnetic field was generated by a core dynamo, driven by compositional convection during core solidification. Cooling models suggest that the onset of core solidification occurred $\sim$200 Ma after planetary accretion. Prior to core solidification, a core dynamo may have been generated by thermal convection; however a thermal dynamo is predicted to be short-lived, with a duration of $\sim$10 Ma to $\sim$40 Ma after planetary accretion. These models predict, therefore, a period of quiescence between the thermally driven dynamo and the compositionally driven dynamo, when no core dynamo should be active. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the magnetic remanence recorded by the Marjalahti and Brenham pallasites, which based on cooling-rate data locked in any magnetic field signals present $\sim$95 Ma to $\sim$135 Ma after planetary accretion, before core solidification began. The cloudy zone, a region of nanoscale tetrataenite islands within a Fe-rich matrix was imaged using X-ray photoemission electron microscopy. The recovered distribution of magnetisation within the cloudy zone suggests that the Marjalahti and Brenham experienced a very weak magnetic field, which may have been induced by a crustal remanence, consistent with the predicted lack of an active core dynamo at this time. We show that the transition from a quiescent period to an active, compositionally driven dynamo has a distinctive paleomagnetic signature, which may be a crucial tool for constraining the time of core solidification on differentiated bodies, including Earth.},
